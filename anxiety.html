				I jump onto my bed to say my goodbyes to all the times it had comforted me. I always knew that clearing out my room would feel nostalgic, but it still surprises me, the LEGOs buried deep in my cupboards, hidden away since my earliest years. My notebooks with all my attempts at writing a novel, even as a kid I loved to write, the drawings of cartoon characters I was in love with: Shaun the Sheep, Pink Panther, Tom and Jerry, the happy memories are almost too much. Between all the childish mess I find my high school diaries. My heart skips a beat. I ruffle through them and snatch the one that reads 2021 Calendar Year Personal Journal my mind goes back to the year I can comfortably call the worst year of my life. Just the sight of the diary has a strong enough feeling to shatter the euphoria of nostalgia into the anguish of lamenting.<br><br>
				
				I dreaded those mornings; my routine had become a prelude to the torture that would commence as soon as I stepped out the house. Sitting in front of the mirror, practising positive self-talk my psychologist had recommended me, clinging on to the ounce of hope that they would work even though I believed they wouldn’t. I’d walk to school with my head kept low and my eyes darting between people, quaking at the sight of anyone looking in my direction. I was terrified of being noticed, because I was sure that people would just see a worthless and pathetic excuse for a human – because that’s how I saw myself.<br><br>

				I brush off the dust on the cover and flip open the diary to a random page. The pages had a slight wilted treasure map look and the faint ink was starting to smudge.<br><br>

				<em><strong>Tuesday 18th July 2021</strong><br>
				Today I overheard my classmates describe me as ‘indifferent’ and a ‘loner’ for the thousandth time this year. Do they not get tired of reiterating the same things every day? I know very well that I’m a loser, but there is no need to say it every single day. Just because I seem tepid doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m cold you judgemental pricks. Even just thinking about them brings back the hollowing feeling of being watched.<br>
				Enough of school-talk, mums coming home late again today and asked me to go to the shops. I’m appalled she hasn’t noticed that I’d rather stay hungry for a day than to go and talk to a cashier at a store, almost as if she doesn’t know me at all.</em><br><br>
				The sick churning feeling I used to feel in my stomach when I would go far too long without food. I somehow find it hard to believe that I would rather starve myself than to talk to someone for a few seconds, even though it was me who was doing it. Why did I never speak up about it though? Why did I think I wasn’t worth the time or money to feed?<br><br>
				
				<em><strong>Wednesday 26th August 2021</strong><br>
				I just came back from my psychology session with Zoey and she just diagnosed me with Social Anxiety Disorder, saying that the reason I developed it is because of my AVPD. Funnily enough, when she first said I had AVPD she explained it to me as though it was just a fancy version of social anxiety but apparently not! Now she tells me that I need talk therapy. What else have we been doing during our past sessions other than talk therapy then?? And she recommended me meditation for the thousandth time even though I’ve told her it does nothing for me! The one person whose job is to understand me when no-one else does is atrocious at doing so.</em><br><br>
				Oh my. Was I so irrational as to be blaming the person that helped me escape from my own cage? I can’t believe this is how I was thinking. It was the very meditation I cursed that allowed me to shift my frame of thought from destructive to constructive. It was this meditation that allowed me to look at not just the world from outside my own eyes, but to see my true self without any of the false preconceptions I held.<br>
				I flick through the pages and spot a tear mark on one and begin to read.<br><br>
				
				<em><strong>Thursday 25th September 2021</strong><br>
				I just can’t with this anymore. Why can’t I be like everyone else. Why can’t I just be normal. Why can’t I just talk to people like a human being. If I’m so useless why am I even alive. No-one cares about me, I’m not contributing anything rather just ruining everything. I have a net negative in evey way shape or form I SHOULD JUST DIE.</em><br><br>
				I slam the diary shut. I remember that day far too well, I ran out of school and locked myself in my room, crying for hours on end, half the time I didn’t even know why I was crying – my face ached – but no matter what, the tears just kept falling onto the mattress. I still remember the countless times where my sadness would slowly turn into frustration and the suddenly become a burst of anger, one where I would pull my hair out or punch the wall. Eventually when my parents came home I had apparently fallen asleep due to exhasution but parts of the blanket had been painted red with my blood and there where multiple holes in the wall.<br>
				I was taken to the hospital and after healing I was prescribed with SSRIs to help manage my conditions. I still remember the look on my parents face when the doctor told them that I had to take an adult does despite the effects it would have on my body.<br><br>
				
				<em><strong>Friday 9th October 2021</strong><br>
				I’ve been ditching school for the past 15 days ever since the incident. Somehow it feels as though I’m more sluggish than a slug, yet ironically I have all the energy in the world when it comes to thinking shit about myself. Maybe if I wasn’t so useless I could put that energy into fixing myself up but oh well. Sucks to suck. Maybe I’ll try those pointless meditation thingys that Zoey used to give me, atleast the illusion of trying to do something might help me.</em><br><br>
				I had really just resigned from life at this point. I feel like I should thank my body from draining all the energy away because who knows what I would have done if I had the energy. I probably wouldn’t be here right now.<br><br>
				
				<em><strong>Saturday 29th November 2021</strong><br>
				It’s halloween in two days, I’ve already set up the 'No candy here' sign outside. Everyone in my class was joking around about how the only scaring thing about Halloween is your sibling stealing all your candy, not only do I not have a sibling, but I’m also too much of a loser to get any candy. I’d tremble out of fear before I even stepped outhe house, let alone knock on a strangers door.<br>
				Despite all that, I do feel slighly less like shit now, almost as if I let go of all the pent up anguish and anger and now the meditation is clearing my mind. Maybe I should have listened to Zoey, maybe this meditation is actually quite good.</em><br><br>
				
				Finally, I had some sense knocked into me. I know that all the things I was going though made me irrational but this is appaling, despite me knowing how real everything felt, it still doesn’t make sense. It’s just how it is, you can’t know how it feels if you haven’t experienced it, what more proof could there be other than someone who has experienced it being shocked when remembering.<br><br>
				
				<em><strong>Sunday 13th December 2021</strong><br>
				I’ve been taking care of myself a little lately and for the first time, I feel as though happiness could be within my reach. Meditation has become one of my favourite daily rituals. I’m back to having my weekly sessions with Zoey and I feel like I’m creating a genuine and real bond with someone.</em><br><br>

				<em><strong>Monday 1st January 2022</strong><br>
				New Year, New Me. I know how corny that sounds but I genuinly believe that this will be that year for me. Maybe ‘New Me’ is an exaggeration but I will finally get to experience life as the real me. I have learnt that I am enough for others, I have learnt to put aside my fear of intimacy and am planning on starting to embrace social connection rather than avoid it. Still yet, I have fears but now I know that I can push past them and live a fulfilling life.</em><br><br>

				Tears fall from my eyes. These were thoughts I had, experiences I lived. Their realness is enough to make me cry even now but no longer is it due to despair but rather triumph. I conquered myself paved the way to become the person I was meant to be.<br>
