			Morality, a word tossed around by many but never truly understood. Morality’s basis lies in different areas for different people. Some base their morality on their own values, some look at morality from a completly factual view, and some from a completely emotional view with most, if not all humans viewing it with a mix of the three. Humans are sentimental beings, we are positioned to make objective decisions but our minds still thrive on and require our emotional needs to be met. Morality is a pillar beyond our physiology that tries to either determine or understand the reasons for what we do and why we do it with it’s primary goal to establish justice among not just our race, but everything we encounter as an organisms.

Morality is something that has no true black and white essence but rather, every inch of it is a gray area. One might ask if you would save a stranger if it meant harming someone you love. One may answer yes, arguing that a human life saved is more valuable than a life’s quality decreased no matter what. Another would argue that the strangers wellbeing isn’t of concern to them and they should protect those they care about. Another would lie in-between, trying to define a line that distinguishes whether the suffering that will be placed onto their loved one is worth the life of a stranger. And one flaw with all of these is that they will almost never agree and will fall into an endless debate about right and wrong, obligation and will.

Are we more afraid of judgement, than we are of being wrong? Those who fear judgement could have a plethora of reasons, some more logical than others. One may have PTSD from a traumatic event as a child, still haunting their day-to-day life in the present, whilst anothers emotional needs were neglected and hence were forced to place their worth in the validation of others. There can be thousands of other reasons but they all will affect someones morals whether directly or indirectly which makes an agreed upon, ‘correct’ morality seems ironically wrong. And if we are afraid of judgement rather than of being wrong than does that mean morality even exists beyond standpoint? Would people’s morals still hold up? And whilst humans typically have a pessimistic view of ourselves and commonly seem to believe that people are instantly selfish, there are situations where it’s the opposite. Our morals have been shown to morph to the people around us when in groups but it has also been shown that people tend to act less-so when there are many around. In many movies there are scenes where people are standing around someone that needs help but they are plainly sympathising rather than helping other than that one person. This is due to the bystander effect stating that the more people are around, the less people act. Our sense of morality and responsibility is diffused as we seem to think that someone else will do it rather than us and are afraid of standing up, looping back to whether we are afraid of judgement. 

But, people are known for acting more socially acceptable in crowds to fit into the social standing just to gain the trust and admiration of others. But even this can’t always be attributed to people losing their morality around others but could be a demonstration that thier experiences and perception of the world has fostered a different sense of morality that isn’t accepted and instills fear into people, not allowing them to be themselves.
