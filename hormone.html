            <span class="header">Definitions & Core Concepts</span><br>
            •	Hormone: A secreted signalling molecule that travels to target cells and acts through a receptor or target mechanism to change physiology.<br>
            •	Gene duplication / neofunctionalization: duplication of a gene followed by divergence of one copy to acquire a novel function.<br>
            •	De novo gene birth: emergence of a novel coding sequence (proto-genes) from previously non-coding DNA, sometimes via transcription/translation of cryptic open reading frames.<br>
            •	Molecular co-option: when an existing protein/gene is repurposed for a different biological role without the need to evolve entirely new sequences.<br>
            •	Promiscuous receptor: a receptor able to bind multiple ligands with variable affinities, creating opportunities for recruitment of new ligands.<br>
            •	Pleiotropy: a single gene or signal having multiple effects across tissues or traits, a major constraint on hormonal novelty.<br><br>

            <span class="header">General Routes by Which a New Hormone Could Possibly Appear</span><br>
            There is no definite way that has substantial evidence to prove that a new hormone could be made but there are a few possibilities that may lead to the creation of a new hormone.<br>
            •	Duplication of an existing hormone gene followed by divergence. This could be thought of as a gene making a back-up of itself, where the original continues to carry out the original job but the new copy is free to change over time. If the changes prove useful enough to the organism, the could change enough to be considered and read as an entirely new hormone.<br>
            •	De novo origin from non-coding DNA. Not all DNA necessarily makes proteins, sometimes part of this non-coding DNA can be read and turned into a peptide (small chain of amino acids) that by-chance, could happen to prove useful to the body. If so, the new peptide could live on through natural selection.<br>
            •	Mixing existing gene pieces. Genes are made of pieces called exons that could be rearranged when the gene is being copied or repaired. If one of these happened to mix together and create a new protein that gets processed and release like a new hormone.<br><br>
            
            <span class="header">How Pre-Exisiting Hormones Could Obtain New Functions</span><br>
            Whilst it isn't entirely possible to create or know how to create a new hormone, human history has had many cases of pre-existing hormones gaining new functions. In fact, this is how humans and other species have evolved. A research article published by T.N. Wittman on Wiley's Online Library under evolution letters discusses in detail how a single hormone can influence multiple traits (pleiotropy).<br>
            CRH receptors are an incredibly old peptide/hormone recepter (traced back to 500 million years ago) which have been found in many invertebrate species and the peptides that link with the receptors have been seen to adopt new funtions and traits. The same CRH receptor has two different forms which came to be due to gene duplication: "Genome duplications led to the divergence of CRH receptors into CRH1 and CRH2 forms" displaying how over-time these receptors can "functionally [...] evolve"<br><br>   

            <span class="header">Natural Selection</span><br>
            Directional selection: environmental pressures (dietary changes, pathogens, reproductive ecology, social structure) can create selective advantages for novel signalling pathways that alter metabolism, immunity, reproduction, or behaviour.<br>
            Population size & drift: small populations may fix neutral/deleterious variants by drift; large populations permit more efficient selection of weakly beneficial novelties.<br>
            Timescale: historical hormone–receptor innovations generally occurred over long evolutionary times (hundreds of thousands to millions of years). Rapid evolution of endocrine traits can occur locally (e.g., in response to strong selection), but the origin of a fully integrated new circulating hormone in humans in a few generations is essentially implausible.<br>
            
            <span class="header">Conclusion</span><br>
            Whilst the creation of a new hormone is highly based in chance and multiple events occuring overtime. A pre-existing hormone or peptide could gain a new function (still through chance). These new funtions could live on through natural selection and this exact chain of events has been seen in the past as it has been happening for millions of years, it's the reason why hormones in organisms are what they are right now.
