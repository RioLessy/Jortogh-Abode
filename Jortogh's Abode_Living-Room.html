    I would've liked to change the backgrounds so that the first page would be more of an entrace sort of vibe and this one a living room rather than both being a bedroom in the background but laziness got the best of me and my dumbass wasn't bothered to spend 5 more hours finding an image and managing to get sidetracked 35 times. I remember this one time I had a science test the next day and went to try and review and spend 7 hours at night studying a pseudoscience called socionics. I ended up pulling an all nighter that night :'(. But socionics is pretty much a more elaborate and researched version of Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Even though I'm practically fluent in it, I don't believe in it whatsoever, it's the dumbest thing ever, one's personality, unconcious and thoughts cannot be dwindled down to letter no matter the context. Our minds are literally labelled as the most complex physical object in the cosmos and people are just summarising the entirety of psychology into these pointless pseudosciences. I'm not saying they are inaccurate, they can be good general indicators but some people believe these for the entirety of their personality.<br> <br>
