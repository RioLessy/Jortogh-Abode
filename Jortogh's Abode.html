    This is a website that I created for the purpose of obtaining a grade of 100% in an Information Technology learning task at school. I wish to recieve 100% but I'm happy as long as I obtain something above 90%. I didn't really know what to write here so I'm just blabbing on about random things at this point. <br> <br>
    Have you heard of <a class="Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a>? It's pretty much just a form of acting that works on a single rule "<em>Yes, and?</em>" which means that whatever someone else does, you accept it and add to it, hence the 'and'. Right now what I'm doing as I'm writing this I'm thinking about what other useless pieces of information can I add to make this longer and adding to it just like improv acting. <br> <br> <br>
    I am doing this website with 3 other tests due the same week. My english podcast started last week and is due on Friday and I have yet to do anything, I have a humanities test today which I know nothing about because I can't focus in classes no matter how <strong>damn</strong> hard I try. i've got a math test which should be fine because for some reason I'm actually good at math, yet the in-class work is all left and is part of the learning task which I am well behind on. This website was started around two to three weeks ago and I started working on it today because I got sidetracked into something else every other <strong>damn</strong> time. I've also got exams in exactly a week and the John Monash Science School (JMSS) entrance exam on Saturday. I'm just ranting at this point but It's better than nothing because right after this I have to finish my English script so my <strong>damn</strong> Enlgish teacher doesn't fail me. The annoying thing is that I brought all of this upon myself and it's not even the first time, this is a normal experience with my academic life, never being able to study, listen and it all catching up to me at some point. And yet, even when I do know this I can't manage to sit and study, I can't seem to start any of my tasks until the very last second. <br> <br>

    I just noticed how long that ranting paragraph is compared to the other ones, welp, it worked, now I'm done with this page of the website! <br> ^_^<br> <br>
